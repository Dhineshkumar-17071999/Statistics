# 1. Measures of Central Tendency

1. Mean (Arithmetic Average):
    * Sum of all data points divided by the number of data points.
    * Sensitive to outliers and skewed data.
    * Example: Average test score of a class.

2. Median:
    * The middle value in a sorted list of numbers. If the number of data points is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.
    * Not affected by outliers or skewed data.
    * Example: Median household income.

3. Mode:
    * The value that appears most frequently in a dataset.
    * Can be used with nominal data.
    * Example: Most common shoe size sold in a store.

### Relationship Between Skewness and Measures of Central Tendency
* In a perfectly symmetric distribution:
    * Mean = Median = Mode.

* In a positively skewed distribution:
    * Mean > Median > Mode.

* In a negatively skewed distribution:
    * Mean < Median < Mode.

### Practical Implications
* Choice of Measure:
    * The mean is useful when the data is symmetrically distributed without outliers.
    * The median is preferred for skewed distributions or when outliers are present, as it better represents the central tendency.
    * The mode is useful for categorical data to determine the most common category.


# 2. Skew
    
* Skew refers to the asymmetry or lack of symmetry in the distribution of data. When data is skewed, it means that the data points tend to cluster more on one side of the mean than the other, creating a distribution that is not symmetric. 

There are two types of skew:

1. Positive Skew (Right Skew):
    * The tail on the right side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the left side.
    * The mean and median are greater than the mode.
    * Examples: Income distributions, real estate prices.

2. Negative Skew (Left Skew):
    * The tail on the left side of the distribution is longer or fatter than the right side.
    * The mean and median are less than the mode.
    * Examples: Age at retirement, time until failure for certain mechanical systems.
